# Equatorial Suport

This repository brings two projects for an equatorial suport to be adapted in an azimutal base, one done using a counterweight to balance the telescope,
and the other using a set of rails to move the telescope so that its center of mass can be placed over the tripod. 

The suport here present was dimensioned for a Meade LX90 telescope, but the concept can be adapted to others, based on their measurements.

Be aware that, depending on the chosen material, some parts need to be thinner, to reduce weight, or thicker, to increase the structural integrity.

The system present in the photos was based on the rail project, being applied in a Meade LX90 telescope. 

The photo was taken in the OAIG observatory (Observatório Astronômico do IFES Guarapari).
